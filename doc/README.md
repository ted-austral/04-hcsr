##  Measure distance with Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04

    IntroCom - Austral - 2022 - EAM
    Uses ESP32 microcontroller

###  Hardware

    1 Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
    cables

###  Connections

    Connect VCC  in HC-SR04 to VIN (+5V) in ESP32
    Connect Trig in HC-SR04 to GPIO "TRIG_PIN"
    Connect Echo in HC-SR04 to GPIO "Echo_PIN"
    Connect GND  in HC-SR04 to GND in ESP32

###  Verification

    Set an obstacle in front of sensor and verify distance as read in serial monitor
